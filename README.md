# Indian Space Research — Starter Repo

## Overview
This repository contains notebooks, helper scripts, and small sample datasets focused on the Indian Space Program (ISRO) so you can explore mission timelines, launch statistics, and simple orbital calculations.

**Goal:** Give you a hands-on, zero-to-run starter project. You do not need to write code — just run the notebooks.

## Files
- `data/` — small CSVs used by the notebooks
- `notebooks/` — Jupyter notebooks (open and Run All)
- `src/` — small Python helper modules
- `references/` — short annotated bibliography

## Setup (beginner-friendly)
1. Install Python via Anaconda (recommended):
   - Download and install Anaconda or Miniconda from https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
2. Create and activate an environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   conda create -n isro-env python=3.10 -y
   conda activate isro-env
   ```
3. Install packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Start Jupyter Lab:
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```
5. In Jupyter Lab open `notebooks/00_setup.ipynb` and click "Run All". Then open the other notebooks in order.

## Notes
- If a notebook asks for a file path, the `data/` folder contains small sample CSVs used by these notebooks.
- Keep the folder structure exactly as shown above.
